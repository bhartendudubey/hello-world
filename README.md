# hello-world
my first repository on github.

Hi Everyone!
  I'm a guy who's interested in technology & innovations. I am an computer science engineering student from Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Noida, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Uttar Pradesh, India. I know a little of Java, python & JavaScript. I'm working on front-end web development. I was a part of Google India Challenge Scholarship(by Udacity). I'm keen to learn more interesting things!
